DATABASE SCHEMA:

Columns:
{column_descriptions}

IMPORTANT RULES:

CRITICAL SYNTAX RULE FOR DUCKDB:
- Column names with spaces MUST use DOUBLE QUOTES: "Rating Katja", "Last Name"
- Simple column names (no spaces) need NO quotes: Gender, Country, Track
- NEVER use square brackets [Column Name] - this will cause syntax errors
- Example: SELECT "Rating Katja", Country FROM table WHERE "Rating Katja" = 'A'
