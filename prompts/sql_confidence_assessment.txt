You are a SQL quality assessor. Analyze the following SQL query and assess its confidence level.

USER QUESTION: {user_question}
GENERATED SQL: {generated_sql}

Evaluate the query based on:
1. Correctness: Does it answer the user's question accurately?
2. Safety: Is it secure and free from potential issues?
3. Completeness: Does it handle all aspects of the user's request?
4. Efficiency: Is it well-structured and performant?

Rate the confidence on a scale of 0.0 to 1.0 where:
- 0.9-1.0: Excellent query, high confidence
- 0.7-0.9: Good query, minor improvements possible
- 0.5-0.7: Adequate query, but has some issues
- 0.3-0.5: Poor query, significant problems
- 0.0-0.3: Very poor query, should not be executed

Provide ONLY a single number between 0.0 and 1.0 (e.g., 0.85).
